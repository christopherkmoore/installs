This will install some stock software for development the easy way. 

<h3>Install.sh</h3>

Will install cli for

- Brew
- Node 
- Git
- CocoaPods (iOS Development)
- Go (I like go for scripting)

It will then check your Applications folder and see if you have Postman, Visual Studio Code, and GitHub Desktop.
If you have any of them it will skip them, if not, it will go ahead and grab them and move them into your Applications folder.

- GitHub Desktop
- VSCode
- Postman

The bundled_zshrc.txt will be used to transfer bash coloring to your ~/.zshrc file. 

Edit out anything unwanted with ## comments
